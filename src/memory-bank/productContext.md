# Product Context: API Veille Informationnelle

## Problem Solved
Users need a centralized way to aggregate and consume information from various online sources, specifically RSS feeds, without having to visit multiple websites or use disparate feed readers. This API provides the backend infrastructure to support such an application.

## Target Audience (Inferred)
- Developers building applications (web, mobile) that require aggregated content feeds.
- End-users of applications built on top of this API who want a personalized information dashboard.

## How It Should Work (High-Level)
1.  **Users Register/Login:** Secure access to personalized feeds.
2.  **Manage Feeds:** Users (or administrators) can add, view, and potentially remove RSS feed sources.
3.  **Subscribe:** Users subscribe to the feeds they are interested in.
4.  **Automatic Fetching:** The system periodically fetches new articles from the added RSS feeds.
5.  **View Articles:** Users can retrieve a consolidated list of articles from their subscribed feeds through the API.

## User Experience Goals (Inferred for API Consumers)
- **Reliability:** The API should consistently fetch and deliver articles.
- **Performance:** Article retrieval should be fast.
- **Ease of Integration:** Clear API documentation (Swagger) and logical endpoints.
- **Security:** Robust authentication and authorization.
